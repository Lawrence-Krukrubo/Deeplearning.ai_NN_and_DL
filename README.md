# Deeplearning.ai Neural Network and Deep Learning Specialization, Course One.
This is the First Course in the Deep-Learning-Specialization  by deeplearning.ai

## Structure:
This course is broken into weekly lectures and programming assignments as well as further readings and coding assignments.

### Week 1: Introduction to deep learning
Be able to explain the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and understand where and how it is applied today.

#### Key Concepts:
* Understand the major trends driving the rise of deep learning.
* Be able to explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning.
* Understand what are the major categories of models (such as CNNs and RNNs), and when they should be applied.
* Be able to recognize the basics of when deep learning will (or will not) work well.

### Week 2: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
**Neural Networks Basics...**, Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. 
Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

#### Key Concepts:
* Build a logistic regression model, structured as a shallow neural network
* Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent.
* Implement computationally efficient, highly vectorized, versions of models.
* Understand how to compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
* Become familiar with Python and Numpy
* Work with iPython Notebooks
* Be able to implement vectorization across multiple training examples

### Week 3: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
**Shallow neural networks...**, Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

#### Key Concepts:
* Understand hidden units and hidden layers
* Be able to apply a variety of activation functions in a neural network.
* Build your first forward and backward propagation with a hidden layer
* Apply random initialization to your neural network
* Become fluent with Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations
* Build and train a neural network with one hidden layer.

### Week 4: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
**Deep Neural Networks...**, Understand the key computations underlying deep learning.
Use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.

#### Key Concepts:
* See deep neural networks as successive blocks put one after each other
* Build and train a deep L-layer Neural Network
* Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations.
* Understand how to use a cache to pass information from forward propagation to back propagation.
* Understand the role of hyperparameters in deep learning

#### Leading Tutors:
This course and its attendant specialization were taught by Andrew Ng, who was the Co-founder and leader of Google Brain, and former Vice-President and Chief-Scientist at Baidu. Andrew is an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the founder of Coursera and deeplearning.ai.
In support of Andrew in teaching this course are Kian katanforoosh and Younes Bensouda Mourri.
